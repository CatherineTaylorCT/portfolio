### The Impact of Urbanisation on Microbial Abundances and Diversity: A Comparative Analysis of Urban Environments

#### Abstract
Urbanisation affects soil health and diversity. DNA sequencing of soil samples can reveal the impact of urbanisation on microbial communities and their nutrient cycles. Using Oxford nanopore amplicon 16S rRNA target gene technology to sequence the DNA found in soil samples collected from urban environments can be processed. Their abundance, diversity and species richness are calculated, which can underpin the microbial communities in abundance or lack of related to specific carbon and nitrogen cycles analysis that can reveal the impact of urbanisation of microorganisms in soil habitats. However, the impact of urbanisation on nitrogen-fixing microorganisms in urban habitats like gardens and university campuses has yet to be discovered. Here, we show a higher abundance in urban universities than in urban gardens. We also found no significant difference between both settings, suggesting that urbanisation around the locations has impacted soil microorganisms and their nutrient cycles similarly due to human activity. Our results demonstrate how urbanisation in these areas affects microbial communities in the soil, yet not all results had a negative impact, like the high abundance of Epsilonproteobacteria. Furthermore, our assay has uncovered the potential for further research into more niche areas, for example, fertiliser application rates and functional genes involved in the nutrient cycles, as well as testing other significance tests in more depth.

#### Introduction

Amplicon sequencing is an affordable and practical Next-generation technology that enables efficient microbial ecology exploration (Grant K.R., 2022). This technique can effectively identify and quantify microorganisms in soil, including bacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses, revealing their diversity and abundance (Zimmerman N. et al., 2014). In addition, amplicon sequencing can reveal novel biochemicals that soil microbes acquire, such as antibiotics and enzymes. The use of this technology by Borčinová M. et al. (2020) proceeded with the discovery of new pharmaceuticals.
 
The data produced by amplicon sequencing can help understand the ecosystem processes, such as nitrogen fixation (Graham E.B. et al., 2014), the decomposition of organic matter, and the carbon cycle (Raza T. et al., 2023). Moreover, soil microbes serve as indicators of environmental quality (Karimi B. et al., 2017), and their identification can aid in predicting the impacts of climate change and the effects of human activities, such as pollution and urbanisation like Huang, L. et al. (2020) explored on the microbial community. Therefore, amplicon sequencing in exploring these concepts can provide valuable insights to improve soil health and reduce the negative impact that human actions have on the natural world.

Urban gardens can alter microbial populations by adding elements such as compost or fertilisers, which can shift microbial diversity and activity (Tresch S. et al., 2019). However, Wang H. et al. (2017) discovered that the excessive use of turfgrass can lead to environmental issues like over-fertilisation and higher emissions of N2O3, a potent greenhouse gas.
Although limited research has explored the impact of urbanisation on nitrogen-fixing microorganisms in gardens, the impact of urbanisation on microorganisms in university campuses is more complex. (King G.M., 2014) The higher foot traffic and various university recreational activities can negatively impact microbial habitats, and varying water management, like opposite extremes of irrigation practices, can affect microbial abundance (Teurlincx S. et al., 2019). The study of human activity, which causes microbial shifts and environmental impacts in universities, needs further exploration. Analysing the impact of human activity using amplicon sequencing for soil microbial populations is critical to alter the negative consequences of urbanisation on microbial ecology and improve soil health (Li M. et al., 2023). 

This study examines the impact of urbanisation on which was once rural and agricultural areas of Essex. Which are now constantly being transformed to meet the growing demand for living spaces (Markey S. et al., 2008). Specifically, the study aims to investigate how urban settings affect microbial abundances and activity in nitrogen and carbon cycles. Our study predicts that urban universities will have a higher abundance of more diverse microbes. But we also anticipate that both urbanisation groups will show no significant difference since human activity has impacted microbial communities in both settings.

#### Discussion

Our investigation of microbial communities in urban university settings and garden areas has revealed some interesting findings. Our study suggests that urban university settings harbour a more abundant and diverse microbial community. This aligns with the hypothesis that increased human activity may contribute to microbial communities' proliferation and diversity (table 1), especially in universities compared to urban gardens. 

Our findings align with prior research outcomes, such as Li G et al. (2018), who reported similar trends in the Richness of microbial communities in urban spaces. It is essential to note that urbanisation could even give rise to antibiotic-resistant genes, which can negatively impact human health. 

Although our results suggest a higher microbial abundance in university environments, the functional implications of this diversity, particularly in critical nutrient cycles like nitrogen and carbon, still need to be fully understood. 
While Alphaproteobacteria were prevalent in university samples (as shown in Figures 2 and 3) and may enhance nutrient cycling processes due to their role in nitrogen fixation. (Tsoy et al., 2016) The garden sample from barcode one (Figure 2) showed a higher abundance of Epsilonproteobacteria, known for their role in the nitrogen cycle, which could be related to over-fertilisation of turfgrass (Soininen et al., 2021). 
However, to gain deeper insights, future research would require an analysis of fertiliser application rates, other soil chemistry parameters, and functional genes involved in the nutrient cycle, as done by Ouyang et al. (2018). These findings from our research highlight the importance of exploring these microbial communities' metabolic activities and ecological functions in future projects.

Microorganisms are essential for nutrient cycling. They decompose organic matter, fix nitrogen, and perform other vital functions for soil fertility and ecosystem health (Prasad et al., 2020). However, an imbalance in
The microbial community, whether due to environmental stressors or human activities, can disrupt these cycles and potentially lead to soil degradation (Cavicchioli et al., 2019).

For instance, increased salinity favouring halophiles like Haloarcula (figure 7) can indicate and contribute to an imbalance in the soil ecosystem (Talaat, 2018). It can suppress other beneficial microbes, alter soil chemistry unfavourably for plant growth, or accumulate toxic compounds.
On the other hand, microbes like Acidicapsa (figure 7) might indicate naturally acidic soils, which do not necessarily affect the ecosystem negatively, as previously studied by Kalam et al. (2020).

The overall impact of these microbes on soil and environmental health and their abundance alone does not indicate a positive or negative effect. It is their interaction with the environment.
The network graph (figure 7) is typically a starting point for further analysis. Future works could explore the significance of the interactions that need to be combined with additional data, such as their metabolic capabilities, to draw more concrete conclusions about their ecological roles and implications for urbanisation.

The methodological approach of our study, although effective in assessing microbial diversity through 16S amplicon sequencing, needed to explore the abundance of microbial communities. There, however, is a limit to this research. Only targeting the 16S rRNA gene has a downfall in finding new or 'unclassified' species ubiquitously (Clarridge, 2004). Our future research could integrate different target gene sequencing like De Filippis et al. (2017) did with 18S ribosomal small subunits. Such studies could also benefit from including fungal communities, providing a more comprehensive picture of microbial diversity.

Our results further raise questions for future studies about the urban activities influencing microbial distribution and abundance compared to rural settings. One hypothesis for future testing is the difference between rural environments and urban environments' microbial diversity, comparing ecosystems and comparing for statistical significance. A methodological shift towards a rural perspective would enable us to address different questions regarding the effects of human actions on microorganism populations and the influence of urban development on a broader scope.

Another limitation of our study is the assumption that microbial abundance equates to ecosystem functionality. Additionally, our focus was on bacterial communities, and including fungal communities in future research could provide a more holistic view of microbial diversity and ecosystem functionality (Wagg et al., 2019).
 
Furthermore, another limitation is that the results need to tell us about the effect of urbanisation alone directly. To determine how urbanisation affects microbial communities, we need a more controlled comparison where the groups are defined by levels of urbanisation, not just the phyla present in the microbial communities.

Our study found no significant statistical differences between urban university and garden settings in microbial abundance and diversity. However, it is important to note that this does not necessarily mean that minor variations do not exist. Future studies that consider a variety of graphs, such as the NMDS graph with a stress level calculation, may reveal a different significance level. 
Additionally, investigating different soil types, vegetation cover, or specific human activities unique to each setting over an extended period of time could shed more light on the impact. 
It is possible that the insignificance of this study could be attributed to similar levels of human activity, pollution, or habitat disturbance in both urban locations. Therefore, it is crucial to continue exploring this topic and conducting further research to understand microbial communities in different environments comprehensively.

In conclusion, our research adds to the body of knowledge on the impact of urbanisation on microbial communities. It highlights the importance of considering these communities in urban planning and restoration (Pavao-Zuckerman, 2008). By understanding the complex relationships between urbanisation, microbial ecology, and environmental health, we can better manage microbial diversity for the sustainability of urban ecosystems. Our study underscores the potential of microbial communities as indicators of environmental health and as agents for ecological restoration and resilience in urban settings.

The Folders above are visual constructs of my CRISPR vector backbone plasmid inserted with the target sgRNA, PAM, and CHimeric guide scaffold. Phython completed another further analysis of the constructed CRISPR plasmid.

The table above is the results from the Benchling CRISPR assembly from my plasmid construct, which is analysed below for the target gene in Yeast.

## RAD52 Benchling CRISPR KO Analysis 

The CRISPR assembly data from Benchling of the highest rank sgRNA sequence chosen from R studio analysis highlights the precision and suitability of your selected sgRNA for gene editing. The cut position at 1218 on the positive strand, directed by the 20-base guide sequence (GGATGTACTACCTTAGAAGG) and the PAM (CGG), ensures that Cas9 will create a double-strand break three base pairs upstream of the PAM site. The high on-target score (76.3) indicates reliable and efficient targeting at the intended site, while the perfect off-target score (100) confirms minimal unintended cleavage, ensuring high specificity. This data confirms that your CRISPR setup is for precise editing of your target gene with excellent efficiency and accuracy.

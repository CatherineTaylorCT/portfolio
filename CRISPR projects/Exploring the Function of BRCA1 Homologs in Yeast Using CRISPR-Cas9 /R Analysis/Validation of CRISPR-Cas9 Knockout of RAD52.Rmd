##### The primary aim of this project is to investigate the functional parallels between RAD52 in yeast and BRCA1 in humans, focusing on homologous recombination (HR) as a DNA repair mechanism. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, the project seeks to knock out RAD52, a critical homolog of BRCA1 in yeast, to study its role in genome stability and response to DNA damage. This research will provide insights into cancer-related mechanisms in human cells by leveraging yeast as a model organism.

##### To identify optimal sgRNA sequences targeting the RAD52 gene, CHOPCHOP, CRISPOR, and Off-Spotter were used. CHOPCHOP ranked sgRNAs based on efficiency, specificity, GC content, and off-target predictions, while CRISPOR provided specificity scores (MIT and CFD), cleavage efficiency, and off-target risks. Off-Spotter confirmed genome-wide off-target predictions by analysing mismatches and their genomic contexts. Among the candidates, Rank 1 sgRNA (AGAACAATGATAAAGAACTGGGG) had an efficiency score of 77, specificity scores of 99 (MIT) and 100 (CFD), minimal off-targets, and a 25% frameshift probability, making it a highly efficient and specific choice. Rank 2 sgRNA (ACAAAACGATGACCACCGCGAGG) demonstrated a 72 efficiency score, perfect specificity (100 MIT and CFD), no off-targets, and a 32% frameshift probability, offering high specificity and reliability. Rank 3 sgRNA (GGATGTACTACCTTAGAAGGCGG) showed a 71 efficiency score, perfect specificity (100 MIT and CFD), one off-target with reduced cleavage likelihood, and a 67% frameshift probability.

##### Next Steps: Further Analysis in RStudio - After evaluating the sgRNA candidates, the top results have been selected for detailed statistical and graphical analysis using RStudio.

##### Table 1 ranks CRISPR gRNA candidates targeting the RAD52 gene in yeast based on normalised z-scores for cutting efficiency, specificity, off-target risks, GC content, and indel rates. The genomic coordinates, sequences, and Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) are listed alongside key metrics such as predicted cutting efficiency (Doench 2016 model), specificity scores (MIT and CFD), number of off-targets, off-target mismatch summary, GC content, out-of-frame indel rate, and Lindel score. Normalised z-scores are provided for each metric: higher scores indicate better performance, with the total score summing all z-scores to determine the overall ranking. Efficiency_z reflects the cutting likelihood, Specificity_z averages MIT and CFD scores, Off_Targets_z favors fewer off-targets, GC_Content_z prioritises sequences with GC content near 50%, and Indel_Rate_z highlights frameshift potential.

# Compute correlation matrix for z-scores
cor_matrix <- gRNA_data %>% 
  select(Efficiency_z, Specificity_z, Off_Targets_z, GC_Content_z, Indel_Rate_z) %>%

```

##### Figure 1 is a correlation plot that visualises the relationships between normalised z-scores of metrics used to evaluate CRISPR gRNA candidates targeting the RAD52 gene. Both the x-axis and y-axis represent z-scores for key metrics, including specificity (average of MIT and CFD scores), off-target predictions (fewer off-targets yield higher scores), GC content (favouring values near 50%), predicted cutting efficiency (Doench '16 model), and out-of-frame indel rates (indicating knockout potential). The size of each bubble indicates the strength of the correlation, with larger circles representing stronger relationships, while the colour shows the direction: red for positive correlations (metrics increasing together), blue for negative correlations (one metric increases as the other decreases), and white for little to no correlation.

##### Figure 2 bar chart illustrates the cutting efficiency of three ranked gRNA sequences targeting the RAD52 gene, as the Doench 2016 model predicted. The x-axis represents the rank of the gRNA sequences (Rank 1, 2, and 3), and the y-axis indicates the cutting efficiency score, with higher values reflecting better efficiency in inducing double-strand breaks. Each bar is colour-coded based on rank: red for Rank 1, green for Rank 2, and blue for Rank 3. The chart shows that Rank 1 has the highest cutting efficiency score, followed by Rank 2 and Rank 3, highlighting the performance differences among the candidates regarding their predicted editing capabilities.

## Summary of Advanced gRNA Analysis 
Through normalised scores and in-depth metric analysis, we identified the top candidate for RAD52 knockout:

- **Optimal Cutting Efficiency**: The selected gRNA has the highest efficiency of all candidates, vital for effective knockout.
- **High Specificity**: A combined high score in both MIT and CFD specificity reduces the likelihood of off-target effects, critical in targeted genome editing.
- **Ideal GC Content**: A balanced GC content close to 50% optimizes binding and stability, enhancing CRISPR-Cas9 interaction.
- **High Indel Likelihood**: A high out-of-frame indel rate suggests a strong potential for a functional knockout, essential for gene disruption studies.

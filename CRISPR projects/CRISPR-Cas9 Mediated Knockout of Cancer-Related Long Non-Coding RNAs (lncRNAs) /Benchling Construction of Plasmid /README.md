The Folders above are visual constructs of my CRISPR vector backbone plasmid inserted with the target sgRNA, PAM, and Chimeric guide scaffold. I then completed another further analysis in Python of the constructed CRISPR plasmid.

The table above is the results from the Benchling CRISPR assembly from my plasmid construct, which is analysed below for the target gene in Yeast.

SRG1 Benchling CRISPR Analysis
The CRISPR assembly data for the pML104 plasmid (Addgene plasmid #67638) used for our experiment revealed the critical details about the guide RNA (gRNA) and PAM sequence, essential for efficient genome editing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The selected gRNA sequence, CAACAAGCTATGAATATGAG, and its associated PAM sequence, CGG, exhibited an on-target score of 31.7 and a perfect off-target score of 100, indicating moderate efficiency with no predicted off-target effects. The plasmid features a high-copy backbone (pRSII426), with dual functionality for Cas9 expression (under the pTDH3 promoter) and gRNA expression (via the pSNR52 promoter). These elements ensure robust and specific targeting of the yeast genome.

##  Using CRISPRa to Investigate the Role of SCRIB Homolog Upregulation in Yeast as a Model for Cancer Therapeutics
This project explores the application of CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) to upregulate BEM1, a yeast homolog of the tumour suppressor gene SCRIB (Hurtado and Rachubinski, 2002), to model therapeutic strategies for restoring tumour suppressor functions in cancer cells. SCRIB maintains cell polarity and regulates cellular organisation and processes often disrupted in cancer progression (Halaoui and McCaffrey, 2014). By studying BEM1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this project aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of restoring tumour-suppressor-like activities.
BEM1's role in cell polarity, cytoskeletal organisation, and signalling pathways makes it a strong analogue for understanding cancer-related processes (Bessa, C. S. S, 2018). Loss of cell polarity is a hallmark of cancer, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. Using CRISPRa to enhance BEM1 expression, this study will assess how upregulation impacts cellular organisation, DNA damage response, and stress resilience in yeast.

## Next Steps

Transform yeast cells with CRISPRa plasmids containing dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to a transcriptional activator such as VP64 and the validated gRNAs.
Select successfully transformed colonies using antibiotic resistance markers and validate the presence of CRISPRa components via PCR.

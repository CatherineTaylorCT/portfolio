The Folders above are visual constructs of my CRISPR vector backbone plasmid inserted with the target sgRNA, PAM, and Chimeric guide scaffold. Phython completed another further analysis of the constructed CRISPR plasmid.

The table above is the results from the Benchling CRISPR assembly from my plasmid construct, which is analysed below for the target gene in Yeast.

## BEM1 CRISPRa Benchling Analysis

This project utilises the pTPGI_dCas9_VP64 plasmid (Addgene plasmid #49013), which encodes a yeast-optimised dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused with the VP64 transcriptional activator under the control of a galactose+aTc-inducible promoter, ensuring precise transcriptional activation. The sgRNA sequence (CTAAACGGACAAATGGCGAA) targets the upstream promoter region of the BEM1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with a cut position at base 11382, adjacent to the PAM sequence (GGG). The high off-target score (100) indicates specificity, while the moderate on-target score (57.2) suggests effective transcriptional activation potential. The plasmid's TRP1 selectable marker and high-copy replication system support robust expression in yeast. Using this CRISPRa system, BEM1 upregulation will be validated via qPCR and Western blot to confirm increased mRNA and protein levels, respectively.

## CRISPR-Cas9 Mediated Knockout of Cancer-Related Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in Yeast

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are regulators of gene expression and have been increasingly recognised for their role in cancer progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance  (Heery et al., 2017). This project aims to investigate the function of lncRNAs in cancer biology by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism to study homologous lncRNA sequences and their regulatory mechanisms. Using CRISPR-Cas9, the project will focus on knocking out yeast homologs of human cancer-associated lncRNAs such as HOTAIR and MALAT1, particularly knocking out the Yeast equivalent gene SRG1, which regulates the SER3 gene by modifying chromatin structure, similar to how cancer-related lncRNAs like HOTAIR alter chromatin states in cancer cells  (Lipovich, Johnson and Lin, 2010). Disrupting SRG1 could reveal insights into how lncRNA-related chromatin changes affect cell cycle progression and stress response. By modelling lncRNA function in Yeast, the project aims to provide novel insights into how lncRNA dysregulation contributes to cancer proliferation and how targeting these molecules could open new avenues for personalised cancer treatment.

## Next Steps

Transform yeast cells with CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids containing the validated gRNAs and Cas9 protein.
Select successful transformants using antibiotic or auxotrophic markers.
Confirm lncRNA knockout via PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of the targeted loci.

These folders contain potential research projects that may be pursued in the future. The topics arise from my strong interest and education in extracurricular courses focused on CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats) Cas9/CRISPRa technology within the context of cancer biology therapeutics. Additionally, my knowledge of cancer genetics and bioinformatics comes from my studies in Genetics at the University of Essex. Each folder represents a research project integrating bioinformatics and research databases, utilising tools such as CRISPOR, ChopChop and Ensembl to identify appropriate sgRNAs (single-guide RNAs). These sgRNAs consist of a targeting sequence (crRNA) complementary to the gene of interest, paired with a PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif) essential for Cas system binding and directing target cutting specificity.

I then analysed the raw data and compared the top-ranked sgRNAs using RStudio to determine the best sgRNA sequence and PAM for implementation in Benchling. In Benchling, I assembled the target region into a plasmid backbone and verified the assembly parameters. To ensure accuracy and reliability, I subsequently checked the CRISPR plasmid in Python, confirming that it was correct and ready for the next steps in the research project.

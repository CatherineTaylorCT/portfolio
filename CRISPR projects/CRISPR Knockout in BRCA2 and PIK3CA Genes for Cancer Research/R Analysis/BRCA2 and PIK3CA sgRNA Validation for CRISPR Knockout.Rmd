### Firstly, CHOPCHOP and CRISPOR platforms were used to identify multiple top sgRNA sequences targeting critical regions of the BRCA2 and PIK3CA genes for CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout. These tools were employed to rank potential sgRNAs based on critical parameters such as specificity, predicted cutting efficiency, and off-target risk. The top three results were selected from both genes and further analysed in R studio to refine the selection process, where efficiency predictions, off-target profiles, and GC content were comprehensively compared.

#### Figure 1 illustrates the number of off-target sites for each sgRNA combination targeting the BRCA2 and PIK3CA genes. The X-axis represents the gene and the specific sgRNA index (e.g., BRCA2_0, BRCA2_1, PIK3CA_3), where the indices correspond to individual sgRNA sequences evaluated for each gene. The Y-axis indicates the total number of off-target sites identified for each sgRNA, as determined through computational analysis. Different colours correspond to each gene-sgRNA pair, visually representing the relative off-target risks. The data highlights that BRCA2_2 has the highest number of off-targets, whereas BRCA2_0 and PIK3CA_3 exhibit lower off-target counts, suggesting they may be more suitable for precise genome editing.

    Mismatches_2 = as.numeric(gsub("2:", "", Mismatches_2)),
    Mismatches_3 = as.numeric(gsub("3:", "", Mismatches_3)),
    Mismatches_4 = as.numeric(gsub("4:", "", Mismatches_4))
  )

#### Figure 2 shows a scatterplot of the relationship between GC content and specificity scores for sgRNAs targeting the BRCA2 and PIK3CA genes. The X-axis represents the GC content of each sgRNA sequence, which affects stability and efficiency in CRISPR experiments. The Y-axis displays the specificity score, which indicates how precisely the sgRNA targets the intended sequence while minimizing off-target effects. Points are colour-coded by gene, with red representing BRCA2 sgRNAs and blue representing PIK3CA sgRNAs. Notably, PIK3CA_3 exhibits a high GC content and a strong specificity score, making it a promising candidate, while BRCA2_2 also shows high GC content but lower specificity.

  geom_segment(aes(xend = reorder(Gene_Index, `Cutting Efficiency`), yend = 0), size = 1) + # Line from x-axis to point
  geom_point(size = 4) + # Points for each Cutting Efficiency value

    y = "Cutting Efficiency"
  ) +

  theme_minimal() + # Minimal theme for clarity

  scale_color_manual(values = scales::hue_pal()(length(unique(df_sorted$Gene)))) # Unique colors for each Gene
```

#### Figure 3 bar plot displays the ranking of sgRNAs based on their cutting efficiency for the BRCA2 and PIK3CA genes. The X-axis represents the cutting efficiency score, which measures the likelihood of successful cleavage at the target site by CRISPR-Cas9. The Y-axis shows the sgRNA indices for each gene, ranked by their cutting efficiency. Points are color-coded by gene, with red indicating BRCA2 sgRNAs and blue indicating PIK3CA sgRNAs. Among the sgRNAs, PIK3CA_4 and PIK3CA_3 exhibit the highest cutting efficiency, close to 0.6, making them strong candidates for precise genome editing. In contrast, BRCA2_1 and BRCA2_0 show lower cutting efficiencies, suggesting they may be less effective. 

```{R}
# Create a lollipop chart showing Number of Off-Targets for each Gene_Index
ggplot(df_sorted, aes(x = reorder(Gene_Index, `Number of Off-Targets`), y = `Number of Off-Targets`, color = Gene)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = reorder(Gene_Index, `Number of Off-Targets`), yend = 0), size = 1) + # Line from x-axis to point
  geom_point(size = 4) + # Points for each Number of Off-Targets value
  labs(
    title = "Ranking of sgRNAs by Number of Off-Targets",
    x = "Gene Index (Ranked by Off-Targets)",
    y = "Number of Off-Targets"
  ) +
  coord_flip() + # Flip coordinates for better readability
  theme_minimal() + # Minimal theme for clarity
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + # Rotate x-axis labels if needed
  scale_color_manual(values = scales::hue_pal()(length(unique(df_sorted$Gene)))) # Unique colors for each Gene
```

#### Figure 4 bar plot ranks sgRNAs by the number of off-target sites for the BRCA2 and PIK3CA genes. The X-axis represents the number of off-target sites identified for each sgRNA, which indicates potential unintended edits elsewhere in the genome. The Y-axis shows the sgRNA indices for each gene, ranked by their off-target counts. Points are colour-coded by gene, with red representing BRCA2 sgRNAs and blue representing PIK3CA sgRNAs. BRCA2_2 exhibits the highest number of off-targets, exceeding 30, while BRCA2_0 and PIK3CA_3 show the fewest off-targets, around 20, making them more favourable for precise genome editing. 

```{R}
# Efficiency prediction visualization
# This will create a bar plot to show the predicted efficiency for each sgRNA
ggplot(df, aes(x = reorder(Gene_Index, `Cutting Efficiency`), y = `Cutting Efficiency`, fill = Gene)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted Efficiency for Each sgRNA",
    x = "sgRNA (Gene Index)",
    y = "Predicted Efficiency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + # Rotate x-axis labels for readability
  scale_fill_viridis_d() # Use the viridis color palette
```

#### Figure 5 bar plot shows the predicted efficiency of sgRNAs targeting the BRCA2 and PIK3CA genes. The X-axis represents the sgRNA indices for each gene, and the Y-axis indicates the predicted cutting efficiency, which reflects the likelihood of successful DNA cleavage at the target site. Bars are colour-coded by gene, purple representing BRCA2 sgRNAs and yellow representing PIK3CA sgRNAs. PIK3CA_4 and PIK3CA_3 exhibit the highest predicted efficiencies, close to 0.6, making them strong candidates for CRISPR-Cas9 experiments. BRCA2_2 also shows relatively high efficiency compared to BRCA2_1 and BRCA2_0, which have lower predicted efficiencies. 

```{R}
# Compare Off-Target Risks and Efficiency Together
# This scatter plot will visualize the trade-off between off-target risk and efficiency
ggplot(df, aes(x = `Cutting Efficiency`, y = `Number of Off-Targets`, color = Gene_Index)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Off-Target Risk vs. Efficiency for sgRNAs",
    x = "Predicted Efficiency",
    y = "Off-Target Risk (Number of Off-Targets)"
  ) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "D") + # Use rainbow-like color palette
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") # Place legend at the bottom for better visualization
```

#### Figure 6 scatter plot illustrates the relationship between off-target risk and predicted efficiency for sgRNAs targeting the BRCA2 and PIK3CA genes. The X-axis represents the predicted efficiency of each sgRNA, indicating the likelihood of successful DNA cleavage. The Y-axis shows the off-target risk, measured as the number of off-target sites identified for each sgRNA. Points are colour-coded by sgRNA index and gene, with shades of purple representing BRCA2 sgRNAs and green representing PIK3CA sgRNAs. Notably, BRCA2_0 exhibits a low off-target risk (~20 sites) and relatively low efficiency, while PIK3CA_4 and PIK3CA_3 demonstrate high predicted efficiencies (~0.5–0.6) with moderate off-target risks. BRCA2_2 has the highest off-target risk (~35 sites) despite moderate efficiency, suggesting potential trade-offs between precision and effectiveness.

 CRISPR Knockout in BRCA2 and PIK3CA Genes for Cancer Research
 
The genes BRCA2 and PIK3CA are crucial in human cancer biology, acting as key regulators of cellular processes(Gorodetska, Kozeretska and Dubrovska, 2019). When these processes are disrupted, tumour development can occur. BRCA2 is essential for DNA repair through homologous recombination, while PIK3CA encodes a subunit of PI3K (Arafeh and Samuels, 2019), an important kinase involved in cell proliferation and survival pathways. Mutations in these genes are often associated with cancers that are inherited, like breast cancer, as well as sporadic cancers, particularly those that are resistant to therapy.
This project uses CRISPR-Cas9 technology to perform targeted knockouts of BRCA2 and PIK3CA in human cell lines, simulating cancer phenotypes driven by mutations. The project's objectives include analysing how the loss of BRCA2 or PIK3CA impacts cellular processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. It also aims to identify potential pathways or genes that might mitigate the effects of these knockouts and provide insights into therapeutic resistance—using RStudio Markdown and Python-based Biopython analyses to validate sgRNA sequences to guarantee experimental accuracy. Cross-referencing with Benchling annotations further confirmed that the plasmid designs are suitable for achieving knockout efficiency with minimal off-target activity. 

Next steps: 
Confirm the CRISPR plasmid integrity through sequencing to ensure the correct sgRNA sequences and essential components (promoter, scaffold, Cas9, etc.).

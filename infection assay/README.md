### Investigating the Impact of Genotype, Sex, and Crotonic Acid Diet on the Survival of Drosophila melanogaster Strains Against Serratia marcescens Infections

##### Abstract

Drosophila melanogaster is a vital model organism for genetic and microbiological research due to its genetic parallels with humans. Understanding how different genotypes, sexes, and environmental treatments affect survival under bacterial infection can provide insights into genetic resilience and susceptibility mechanisms. However, survival analysis has yet to explore the Daxx mutant genotype. This study explores the survival outcomes of Drosophila melanogaster, focusing on the Dahomey wild-type and Daxx mutants when subjected to Serratia marcescens infections and crotonic acid treatment. We show that male flies and the Dahomey genotype exhibit higher survival probabilities than female flies and Daxx mutants with a p-value of <0.0001.
Additionally, while crotonic acid treatment did not significantly impact overall survival rates  0.323 p-values, it delayed developmental timing in Daxx mutants. These findings suggest that sex and genotype significantly influence Drosophila's resilience to bacterial infections, with males and Dahomey flies showing more excellent resistance. The study also highlights the potential physiological effects of histone crotonylation, such as delayed development. Our results underscore the importance of considering genetic and environmental factors in studying immune responses and survival, providing a foundation for future research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences. Further investigations could explore the specific gene expression profiles and the broader impacts of crotonylation on Drosophila physiology.

##### Introduction

Drosophila melanogaster is widely used as a research model due to its genetic similarities to humans, possessing only 7,000 fewer genes (Markstein, M. 2018). The shotgun sequencing of its genome in the 2000s (Neckameyer, W.S. and Argue, K.J. 2013) has facilitated precise control of gene expression in specific cells at regulated times and levels (Pfeiffer, B.D. et al. 2010).

The Dahomey strain, a robust wild-type strain from West Africa, is often used as a control due to its health and longevity (Gubina et al., 2018). In contrast, the Daxx[NP4778] strain  (Death domain-associated protein), with a mutation in the Daxx gene, exhibits altered stress responses and immune function, potentially affecting longevity and disease susceptibility (Tang, Wan, and Wu, 2015). Dahomey flies generally show higher survival rates when infected with Serratia marcescens than some mutant strains, likely due to their robust immune response (Rose et al., 2022).

Sex differences significantly influence survival outcomes in Drosophila. Typically, males show higher resilience to infections and stressors than females, possibly due to physiological, hormonal, and immune function differences (Lin et al., 2023). While both sexes in the Dahomey strain exhibit vital survival against S. marcescens (Rose et al., 2022), it remains unexplored in the Daxx[NP4778] strain.

This study investigates survival probabilities of different genotypes, sex, and treatment conditions (diet of crotonic acid) in response to Serratia marcescens infections in Drosophila melanogaster. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for advancing genetic and microbiological research.
Drosophila’s unique features, such as the easy isolation of polytene chromosomes from larval salivary glands and the advanced genetic tools available, facilitate studying post-translational modifications (PTMs)(Koryakov and Zhimulev, 2014). PTMs, including crotonylation, a histone PTM, involve adding a crotonyl group (crotonic acid) to lysine residues on histones, impacting chromatin compaction and accessibility (Ntorla and Burgoyne, 2021). Studies using Drosophila have revealed that crotonylation marks are distributed across the genome and are associated with both active and repressed chromatin states, highlighting the complexity of PTM-mediated regulation of gene expression (Boros, 2012).
 Genome-wide studies in Drosophila have mapped the distribution of crotonylation marks, indicating enrichment at promoters and enhancers of active genes, suggesting a role in transcriptional activation (Stow et al., 2022). However, crotonylation has not been further studied on different genotypes (Daxx or Dahomey) or under survival analysis of infection, in particular Serratia marcescens and their link to survival or earlier death, and the possibility of affecting the next generation with this susceptibility from the altering chromatin structure.

This study aims to enhance understanding of survival outcomes in specific genotypes under controlled conditions. We hypothesize significant survival differences between sexes, with males showing greater resilience to S. marcescens. Additionally, the Dahomey genotype is expected to have higher survival rates than the Daxx genotype under the same conditions, and specific environmental treatments (e.g., P.ent. vs vehicle) will significantly impact survival probabilities. Furthermore, interactions between genotype, sex, and diet of crotonic acid are anticipated to yield significant variations. For example, Daxx and a diet of crotonic acid will delay egg laying and later development of hatching a day later than the Daxx or Dahomey Drosophila eating regular food or Dahomey on the crotonic acid diet, either impacting survival outcomes, influencing susceptibility to infection.

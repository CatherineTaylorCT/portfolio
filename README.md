## This portfolio showcases projects and research, including raw data analysis, biodiversity assessments, infection assays, and CRISPR research. 

# Contents

## CRISPR Projects

- Gene editing projects focusing on cancer therapeutics using CRISPR tools.
- Bioinformatic tools were used to analyse tumour suppressor genes, long non-coding RNAs, and homologous recombination pathways.
- Used RStudio to design and validation of sgRNA guides and PAM sites.
- Benchling and Python were used for CRISPR plasmid creation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cell lines.


## Water Samples

- Comprehensive biodiversity studies in water, soil, and rockpool ecosystems.
- Using RStudio Data cleaning, processing, and assessment for The Colne River Assessment Project (CRAP).
- Data analysis and research from academic internships and bursary-funded projects.

## Infection Assay

- Research conducted as part of the Frontrunners Internship.
- Data analysis in RStudio of survival infection assays of Drosophila Melanogaster from being involved in a team project.


## Rockpool Studies

- Species richness and significance evaluations.
- Biodiversity analysis using RStudio in rockpool ecosystems.


## Soil Samples

- Analysis of soil biodiversity and species richness.
- Data processing and code improvements using RStudio.

This portfolio contains collections of raw data (from outside sources as well as my own class data), which I have studied independently by cleaning, processing, and analysing the biodiversity of all samples, species richness, and any other significance. This portfolio also contains data and data analysis of survival infection assays of Drosophila Melanogaster from being involved in a team project in the Frontrunners Internship. 
As well as a new data analysis of The Colne River Assessment Project (CRAP) which is an ongoing project focused on monitoring and assessing the biodiversity and water quality in various waterways across East Essex and Suffolk.

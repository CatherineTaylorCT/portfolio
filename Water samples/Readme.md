This data analysis was completed as a side project alongside my internship at the Uiversity of Essex as an Undergraduate Student (6 weeks starting July 22nd 2024) to conduct a project investigating Airborne antimicrobial resistant microorganisms. Gaining skills in fieldwork, molecular
microbiology/ecology, and data analysis. And contribute to a large EU consortium investigating air quality across Europe, learning from scientists from a range of disciplines.

The bursary is funded by the UK aerosol society https://aerosol-soc.com/ is linked to ongoing
research projects funded by the Academy of Medical Sciences and the European Commission. Working with Dr Rob Ferguson, Dr Lizzie Archer, Drew Henderson
and Prof Ian Colbeck.

Introduction-
The Colne River Assessment Project (CRAP) is an ongoing initiative focused on monitoring and assessing the biodiversity and water quality in various waterways across East Essex and Suffolk. Over the past year, the project collected water samples from key water bodies, including the Colne, Stour, Hythe, and Tollesbury rivers. These samples were analyzed to evaluate the levels of E. coli, Enterococcus, and antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (AMR) such as Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) and Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE). The project involved volunteers and experts like Drew Henderson and Rob Furguson from the University of Essex. The primary goal was to understand how environmental factors, particularly tide conditions, impact bacterial contamination and to compare the microbial levels against UK inland bathing water standards.

Discussion- 
Figures 1-5 illustrate the comparative concentrations of various bacterial contaminants. One key observation is that Colne and Stour exhibit consistently higher contamination levels than Roman and Blackwater, particularly during slack and flood tides. This suggests that the tidal influence plays a significant role in bacterial concentration, with the slack tide showing a potential accumulation of contaminants due to slower water movement. The E. coli concentrations in Stour during slack tide, which surpass the Poor threshold (Figures 6 & 7), further highlight how tidal stagnation can enhance bacterial persistence in water. Additionally, VRE and ESBL levels (Figure 14) were more pronounced in Blackwater and Colne compared to Roman and Stour. This distribution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) suggests that certain waterways are more prone to ARB contamination, potentially due to localized sources of pollution, such as wastewater treatment plants or agricultural runoff. Slack tides, in particular, have been shown to reduce water exchange rates, promoting higher concentrations of contaminants. These elevated levels during slack tides could be a function of dilution rates and proximity to contamination sources such as wastewater outfalls. The seasonal analysis in Figures 12-14 reveals clear temporal trends in bacterial contamination. E. coli and Enterococci levels peaked in August, coinciding with warmer temperatures and increased human activity (e.g., recreational water use and agricultural runoff). For example, Figure 20 shows a significant spike in E. coli levels in August at Hy_WWTP_1, likely due to higher effluent discharge rates during periods of increased wastewater processing. Similarly, Enterococci levels at Hy_2 in August indicate heightened contamination from agricultural sources or surface runoff. These results support the notion that summer months, particularly August, are associated with higher bacterial loads due to increased surface runoff, higher temperatures promoting bacterial growth, and potentially higher wastewater discharges. In contrast, the decline in bacterial concentrations in October (Figure 20), particularly at Hy_1 and Hy_2, suggests a seasonal flushing of contaminants or reduced inputs from anthropogenic sources. This pattern underscores the dynamic nature of bacterial contamination in waterways, where environmental factors (e.g., precipitation and temperature) and human activities drive the observed variability. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as VRE and ESBL, were found to vary in concentration across waterways, as shown in Figures 12-14. The higher ESBL levels in Blackwater and Colne than in other waterways suggest that these areas may be receiving inputs from sources such as hospital wastewater, which is known to contain high levels of resistant bacteria. Figure 9, in particular, shows that ESBL concentrations in Blackwater during ebb tide exceed the Poor threshold, which could indicate the persistence and amplification of antibiotic resistance in this area. This pattern highlights a primary public health concern, as resistant bacteria pose a significant challenge regarding water safety and the risk of disease transmission. The presence of ARB in aquatic environments has been increasingly recognized as a severe environmental and public health issue. Studies have shown that antibiotic-resistant bacteria can survive in various environmental settings, such as estuaries and rivers, and their spread is facilitated by human activity and wastewater discharges. Your studyâ€™s findings further confirm this risk, particularly in urbanized areas like Colne and Blackwater, where human-derived contaminants are likely contributing to the high levels of ARB. Figures 6 and 7 compare E. coli and Total Coliform levels during various tidal phases. Stour consistently exhibits higher E. coli concentrations during slack tide, surpassing the Poor water quality threshold. These elevated E. coli levels signal significant faecal contamination from agricultural runoff, stormwater, or inadequate wastewater treatment. This result is consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated the vulnerability of agricultural catchment areas to faecal pollution, particularly during periods of low water flow or tidal slack. Moreover, Figures 10 and 11 summarize the water quality classifications for E. coli and Enterococci across months, showing August as the month with the highest number of Excellent classifications. This finding could be attributed to variations in sampling locations during August or lower-than-expected contamination in certain areas. However, the predominance of Poor classifications during other months (e.g., September and October) underlines the variability in water quality across time and space. In conclusion, the analysis of bacterial contamination across different waterways, tidal phases, and months reveals significant spatial and temporal variability. The Colne and Stour waterways exhibit consistently higher bacterial concentrations, particularly during slack tides, while Blackwater shows elevated levels of ARB. The peak contamination levels in August highlight the influence of seasonal factors on water quality. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose a significant environmental health concern, warranting immediate attention from environmental management agencies and public health authorities.
